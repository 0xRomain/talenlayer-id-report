Scenarios exploration:
Compromised wallet. (User / platform manager)

What if an arbitrator is updated while a dispute is in progress ?
As a user, what if my wallet gets compromised ?
As a platform owner, what if my wallet gets compromised ?
What if contracts owner gets compromised ?
As a user, what if I want to disappear ?
As a user, how can I ask for a review update ?
What if I want to hide a review ?


Impossible to burn an id ??
Right to forgiveness ?

Review process: very basic. Cannot ask for review before approval.
Cannot choose to approve it or not.

User experience
If buyer’s wallet gets compromised: can release all funds, 
If services provider’s wallet gets compromised.



 Il se passe quoi si un arbitrator est enlevé de la liste des officiels alors qu'il y a des litiges en cours ?

 2 comptes complices pourraient-ils vider l'escrow ?
